[Gabi](https://twitter.com/gabidavila) is back with [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) this week in an interview with [Connor Gilbert](https://twitter.com/connorgilbert) of [StackRox](https://twitter.com/stackrox), a Kubernetes security company. StackRox uses Kubernetes and containers to maximize security for customers across the container lifecycle. Connor explains how they monitor your containers through building, deploying, and finally the running of the application, and keep your project secure through all stages. StackRox identifies risks and weak areas, then responds in real time. 

Connor's advice for our listeners is to understand what's going on with your containers and your application. Look at the data, the specs, and your options and then, if-needed, adjust the defaults to optimize the security of your app.
