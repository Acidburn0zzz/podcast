[Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) and [Brian Dorsey](https://twitter.com/briandorsey) spend today talking Python with [Dustin Ingram](https://twitter.com/di_codes). Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language, which encourages very readable code. Python is popular for web applications, data science, and much more!  Python works great on Google Cloud, especially with App Engine, Compute Engine, and Cloud Functions. To learn more about best (and worst) use cases, listen in!
