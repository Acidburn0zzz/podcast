Welcome to day three of Next! More awesome interviews await in this episode, as hosts [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch), [Aja Hammerly](https://twitter.com/the_thagomizer), [Mark Mandel](https://twitter.com/Neurotic), [Jon Foust](https://twitter.com/syntxerror1) and their guests explore more of Next.

To start, Dan of Viacom joins Mark and Jon to talk about his job in the TV business and why he loves Istio. 

Host-turned-guest Aja and Lauren of the Developer Relations team sat in the booth to talk with the Marks about the developer keynote at Next. Aja and Lauren elaborate on how they work to promote Next and put together content inclusive of all aspects of Google Cloud. 

Mark and Mark hear how Yuri from Scotiabank is using Kubernetes to help advance Scotiabank's latest projects. Anthony from Google joins the conversation, too. 

And lastly, we tease you with a short interview with Andrew of MongoDB to speak more on the partnership between MongoDB Atlas and Google Cloud. Andrew will be joining us for a full interview on the podcast later this year!
