Bringing you a special second episode this week with Matt Linton and Paul Turner sharing insights with [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) and [Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl) about the CPU vulnerabilities, Spectre & Meltdown, and how Google coordinated and managed security with the broader community. We talked about how there has been minimal to no performance impact for GCP users and GCP's Live Migration helped deploy patches and mitigations without requiring maintenance downtime.

Due to the special nature, no cool things or question included on this podcast.
