##### About Daniel Smith

Currently TL of the API Machinery sub-team, [Daniel](https://twitter.com/originalavalamp) has been working on Kubernetes since before it was open sourced, 
and contributed enough in the early days that heâ€™s still one of the top contributors overall. 
Before that, Daniel worked on Borg and briefly on AppEngine. He lives in Mountain View with his wife and two children.
