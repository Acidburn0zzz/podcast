[Nick Sullivan](https://twitter.com/grittygrease), and  [Adam Langley](https://twitter.com/agl_) join [Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) to provide a pragmatic view on post-quantum cryptography and what it means to research security for the potential of quantum computing. Post-quantum cryptography is about developing algorithms that are resistant to quantum computers in conjunction with "classical" computers. It's about looking at the full picture of potential threats and planning on how to address them using a diversity of types of mathematics in the research. Adam and Nick help clarify the different terminology and techniques that are applied in the research and give a practical understanding of what to expect from a security perspective.
