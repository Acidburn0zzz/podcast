[Bryan Catanzaro](https://twitter.com/ctnzr), the VP Applied Deep Learning Research at NVIDIA, joins [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) and [Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl) this week to discuss how his team uses applied deep learning to make NVIDIA products and processes better. We talk about parallel processing and compute with GPUs as well as his team's research in graphics, text and audio to change how these forms of communication are created and rendered by using deep learning. 

This week we are also joined by a special co-host, [Sherol Chen](https://twitter.com/ffpaladin) who is a developer advocate on GCP and machine learning researcher on Magenta at Google. Listen at the end of the podcast where Mark and Sherol chat about all things GDC.

##### Bryan Catanzaro

Bryan Catanzaro is VP of Applied Deep Learning Research at NVIDIA, where he leads a team solving problems in domains ranging from video games to chip design using deep learning. Bryan earned his PhD from Berkeley, where he focused on parallel computing, machine learning, and programming models. He earned his MS and BS from Brigham Young University, where he worked on higher radix floating-point representations for FPGAs.
Bryan worked at Baidu to create next generation systems for training and deploying deep learning models for speech recognition. Before that, he was a researcher at NVIDIA, where he worked on programming models for parallel processors, as well as libraries for deep learning, which culminated in the creation of the widely used CUDNN library.
