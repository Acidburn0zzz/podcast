[Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) is our Mark this week, joining new host [Michelle Casbon](https://twitter.com/texasmichelle) in a recap of their favorite things at Next! The main story this episode is Cloud Run, and [Gabi](https://twitter.com/gabidavila) and Mark met up with Steren Giannini and Ryan Gregg at Cloud Next to learn more about it. 

Announced at Next, Cloud Run brings serverless to containers! It offers great options and security, and the client only pays for what they use. With containers, developers can use any language, any library, any software, anything! 

Two versions of Cloud Run were released last week. Cloud Run is the fully managed, hosted service for running serverless containers. The second version, Cloud Run GKE, provides a lot of the same benefits, but runs the compute inside your Kubernetes container. It's easy to move between the two if your needs change as well.
