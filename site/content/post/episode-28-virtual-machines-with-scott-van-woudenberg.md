##### About Scott

[Scott Van Woudenberg](https://twitter.com/scottjvw) spent sixteen years as a software engineer
and engineering lead/manager before moving over to product management. He joined Google in 2012
as a Product Manager on Google Compute Engine, mere weeks before its public alpha launch at I/O.

He's remained a PM on GCE, helping to guide and build the service into a GA product which
has seen exponential growth every year since going public.
