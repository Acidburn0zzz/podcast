Eli Bixby, Developer Programs Engineer at Google, tells your cohosts
[Francesc](https://twitter.com/francesc) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/neurotic)
all about [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and its applications.
Do you want to know what neural networks are? Why does TensorFlow exists? How to get
started with it? We cover that and more in our thirsty first episode.
