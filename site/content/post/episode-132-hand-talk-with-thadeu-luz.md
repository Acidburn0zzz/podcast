[Thadeu Luz](https://twitter.com/thadeuluz) from Hand Talk shares with [Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) how the free Hand Talk education application translates and interprets spoken and written Portuguese into Brazilian Sign Language (aka LIBRAS or BSL). The application uses an animated avatar Hugo to deliver the signs through gestures and facial expressions and its built off of a statistical machine translation system and Firebase. Future plans include expanding into other languages with a priority on ASL and they welcome support.
