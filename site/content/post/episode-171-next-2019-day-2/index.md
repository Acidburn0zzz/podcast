The podcast celebrates day two of Next as our hosts speak with some more conference attendees. Andre came by to talk with [Aja](https://twitter.com/the_thagomizer) and [Jon](https://twitter.com/syntxerror1) about his work with Stackdriver IRM and their mission for fewer, shorter, and smaller outages.  

We had three hosts in the booth with guest, Anne, who works for the GCP Trust and Security Product Team. [Brian](https://twitter.com/briandorsey), [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic), and Aja find out exactly what Anne does at GCP and how she's enjoying Next! 

Brian and Mark also met up with Mario who came all the way from Munich, Germany. Mario runs the Cloud Community in his hometown, and he shared his thoughts on Anthos and what he's excited about at Next.

Last but not least, Valentin stopped by to talk with Mark and Jon about Go and the presentation he's giving at Next on site performance.
