We're learning all about Cloud SQL this week with our guest, [Amy Krishnamohan](https://twitter.com/amykrishnamohan). Amy's main job is to teach customers about the products she represents. Today, she explains to [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) and [Gabi](https://twitter.com/gabidavila) that Cloud SQL manages services for open source databases, and she spends a little time elaborating on the other database management services Google has to offer.

Cloud SQL is a relational data storage solution. Relational data storage is very structured, almost like a table or spreadsheet, making it easier to analyze the data.  Cloud SQL is capable of scaling out and up, meaning it can scale for traffic patterns and for storage. In comparison, NoSQL databases are very unstructured. If you're not sure what kind of data is coming in, you can sort the data first and analyze it later. Each approach has its pros and cons and each is suitable for different types of projects.

Recently, Cloud SQL released a feature making it easy to move from on-prem to the cloud. In the future, they will continue to streamline the process of moving between the two spaces.
