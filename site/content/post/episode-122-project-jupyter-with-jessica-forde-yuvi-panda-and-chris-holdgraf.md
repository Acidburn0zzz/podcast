[Jessica Forde](https://github.com/jzf2101), [Yuvi Panda](https://twitter.com/yuvipanda?lang=en) and [Chris Holdgraf](https://twitter.com/choldgraf) join [Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) to discuss Project Jupyter from it's interactive notebook origin story to the various open source modular projects it's grown into supporting data research and applications. We dive specifically into JupyterHub using Kubernetes to enable a multi-user server. We also talk about Binder, an interactive development environment that makes work easily reproducible.

##### Jessica Forde
[Jessica Forde](https://github.com/jzf2101) is a Project Jupyter Maintainer and a visiting academic at NYU Center for Data Science. Her research focus is applications that allow for human interaction, primarily in healthcare. Jessica is also a data scientist at Careful, a sports medicine startup. Her interest in industrial applications of reinforcement learning began at Columbia, where she developed energy-saving software for skyscrapers in Manhattan, which she demoed at NIPS. Previously, Jessica developed the DARPA-funded open source machine learning library, datamicroscopes, at Qadium. She has worked with consultants at McKinsey to provide data-driven human resources recommendations to clients. 

##### Yuvi Panda
[Yuvi Panda](https://twitter.com/yuvipanda?lang=en) is the Project Jupyter Technical Operations Architect in the UC Berkeley Data Sciences Division. He works on making it easy for people who don’t traditionally consider themselves "programmers" to do things with code. He builds tools (e.g., Quarry, PAWS, etc.) to sidestep the list of historical accidents that constitute the "command line tax" that people have to pay before doing productive things with computing. 


##### Chris Holdgraf
[Chris Holdgraf](https://twitter.com/choldgraf) is a is a Project Jupyter Maintainer and Data Science Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and a Community Architect at the Data Science Education Program at UC Berkeley. His background is in cognitive and computational neuroscience, where he used predictive models to understand the auditory system in the human brain. He's interested in the boundary between technology, open-source software, and scientific workflows, as well as creating new pathways for this kind of work in science and the academy. He's a core member of Project Jupyter, specifically working with JupyterHub and Binder, two open-source projects that make it easier for researchers and educators to do their work in the cloud. He works on these core tools, along with research and educational projects that use these tools at Berkeley and in the broader open science community.
