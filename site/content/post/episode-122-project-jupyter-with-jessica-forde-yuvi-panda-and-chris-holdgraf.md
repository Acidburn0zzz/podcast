[Jessica Forde](https://github.com/jzf2101), [Yuvi Panda](https://twitter.com/yuvipanda?lang=en) and [Chris Holdgraf](https://twitter.com/choldgraf) join
[Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) and [Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl) to discuss 
Project Jupyter from its origin story to the various projects supporting data research and applications. We dive into JupyterHub and the role Kubernetes plays as well as Binder.

##### Chris Holdgraf
Chris Holdgraf is a Data Science Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and a Community Architect at the Data Science Education Program at UC Berkeley. His background is in cognitive and computational neuroscience, where he used predictive models to understand the auditory system in the human brain. He's interested in the boundary between technology, open-source software, and scientific workflows, as well as creating new pathways for this kind of work in science and the academy. He's a core member of Project Jupyter, specifically working with JupyterHub and Binder, two open-source projects that make it easier for researchers and educators to do their work in the cloud. He works on these core tools, along with research and educational projects that use these tools at Berkeley and in the broader open science community.
