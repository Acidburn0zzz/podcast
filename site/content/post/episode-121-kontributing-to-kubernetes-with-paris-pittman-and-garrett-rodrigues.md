##### Paris Pittman
Co-Chair of Contributor Experience Special Interest Group for Kubernetes.    
Bay Area Kubernetes Meetup Co-Organizer

[Paris](https://twitter.com/parisinbmore) is a Developer Relations Program Manager on the Google Cloud Open Source Strategy team focusing on Kubernetes Community. She has 13 years of professional experience in attracting, retaining, growing, and incentivizing engineering talent for organizations and open source projects. She has also been organizing communities in one form or another for over 20 years, and at one point ran enough hackathons and meetups to subsist solely on the free pizza leftovers. 

##### Garrett Rodrigues
Technical Lead of the Contributor Experience SIG for Kubernetes.

[Garrett](https://twitter.com/grodrigues3) is a Technical Program Manager at Google, and he joined the Kubernetes and GKE Team at Google in June 2016.  As a lead of ContribX, he has focused on scaling the Kubernetes project in a sustainable way.  Garrett developed a lot of the tooling and automation to support OSS code review, issue triage, and data collection about the project.  In addition to his work on Contributor Experience, Garrett is currently involved with the app-def working group to get a new declarative application management tool released.
