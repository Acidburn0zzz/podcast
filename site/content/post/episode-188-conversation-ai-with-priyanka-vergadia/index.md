The podcast today is all about conversational AI and Dialogflow with our Google guest, [Priyanka Vergadia](https://twitter.com/pvergadia). Priyanka explains to [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) and [Brian Dorsey](https://twitter.com/briandorsey) that conversational AI includes anything with a conversational component, such as chatbots, in anything from apps, to websites, to messenger programs. If it uses natural language understanding and processing to help humans and machines communicate, it can be classified as conversational AI. These programs work as translators so humans and computers can chat seamlessly.

We discuss how people interact with conversational AI, maybe without even realizing it. From asking Google Home to set your alarm to getting customer service support at your favorite online store, AI is probably working behind the scenes to help. Priyanka also tells us all about Google's natural language understanding and processing program, Dialogflow. Designed to simplify the process, Dialogflow allows you to input a simple idea like asking for coffee, and watch as the program automatically includes many of the different ways people would naturally ask for coffee. Coffee would be great right now!

Listen in to find out the best (and worst) use cases and practices for this powerful tool!
