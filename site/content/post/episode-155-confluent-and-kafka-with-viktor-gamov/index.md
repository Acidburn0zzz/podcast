[Viktor Gamov](https://twitter.com/gamussa) is on the podcast today to discuss Confluent and Kafka with [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) and special first-time guest host, [Michelle](https://twitter.com/texasmichelle). Viktor spends time with Mark and [Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl) explaining how Kafka allows you to stream and process data in real-time, and how Kafka helps Confluent with its advanced streaming capabilities. Confluent Cloud helps connect Confluent and cloud platforms such as Google Cloud so customers don't have to manage anything - Confluent takes care of it for you! 

To wrap up the show, Michelle answers our question of the week about Next 2019.
