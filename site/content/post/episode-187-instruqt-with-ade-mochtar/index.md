[Jon Foust](https://twitter.com/syntxerror1) and [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) are joined by Adé Mochtar to discuss the IT learning platform, [Instruqt](https://twitter.com/instruqt) and how they create and manage the platform with the help of Google Cloud. [Sandeep](https://twitter.com/sandeepdinesh) of Google stops in with the info on the Instruqt arcade games we saw at Google Next '19.

Instruqt's main philosophy is that people learn best by doing, and their courses encourage immersion right off the bat. Developers are asked coding questions and allowed to work in sandbox environments to fully expose them to the subject. Instruqt checks the student's work as they continue through the program to ensure the material is being properly learned. 

But learning should be fun, too! By putting developer challenges on old-style arcade machines, developers can test their coding skills, learn new things, and have fun at the same time. At conferences, this has been a great way to engage their target audience. Google Cloud games were run on the Instruqt platform at Next '19, and conference attendees came back day after day to try to get on the high score leaderboard. It was a super fun way to get people using Google Cloud technologies!

##### Adé Mochtar

Adé is Co-Founder and CTO of Instruqt, a hands-on learning platform for IT technology. Before starting Instruqt, he was an engineer and consultant in Cloud and DevOps-related topics. A big part of that job was to educate organizations on how to adopt new technology. With Instruqt, he tries to achieve the same but on a larger scale. His mission is to make learning DevOps and Cloud more effective and fun. At Instruqt, Adé mainly focuses on back-end and infrastructure engineering using Terraform, Go, and (probably too much) Bash.
