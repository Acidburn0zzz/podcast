##### Ann Wallace

[Ann Wallace](https://twitter.com/annnwallace) is the Global Security Practice Lead for Google PSO. She has spent the last 6 months building out the security practice. Ann is passionate about inclusion in tech. She is the West regional lead for Google Cloud EDII and a volunteer with Women Who Code Portland. Before Google Ann spent 14 years at Nike in various engineering and architecture roles. CloudNOW named her one of the top 10 Women in Cloud in 2015. When not working, Ann can be found ultra-trail running around the world.

##### Michael Wallman

[Michael Wallman](https://twitter.com/@berkeleyboo) is a TPM, working on Cloud Migration for internal Alphabet companies and acquisitions. He also serves as the America’s infrastructure practice lead.   He is in his 3rd year at Google. Prior to Google, Michael is Cloud “OG”, and spent almost 5 years growing the AWS Professional Services organization from 5 to 700+. Before sticking his head in the clouds,  Michael helped found 2 start-ups: Aspera and SensysNetworks. Outside of work Michael spends his time chasing his 2 toddlers and mountain lions around the Berkeley Hills.  

Ann and Michael actually met 5 years ago, working on Nike’s first cloud migration project. This encompassed reverse engineering a custom Perl configuration management system. (Who doesn’t love Perl?) It’s a small cloud world.
