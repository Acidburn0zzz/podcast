On the show today, we speak with Developer Advocate and fellow Googler, [Sherol Chen](https://twitter.com/ffpaladin) about machine learning and AI. [Jon Foust](https://twitter.com/syntxerror1) and [Aja Hammerly](https://twitter.com/the_thagomizer) learn about the history and impact of AI and ML on technology and gaming. What does it mean to be human? What can machines do better than humans, and what can humans do better than machines? These are the large questions that we aim to solve in order to understand and use AI. Sherol goes on to explain the types of deep learning machines can achieve, from neural networks to decision trees.

Sherol also went into depth about the potential social impact of AI as it assists doctors parsing through medical records and plans agricultural endeavors to maximize food production and safety. Sherol also elaborates on the ethical responsibilities we must realize when developing AI projects. 

For developers looking to build a new AI project, Sherol outlines the pros and cons of using existing tools like Cloud Speech-to-Text, AutoML and AutoML Tables.
