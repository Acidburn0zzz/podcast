##### About Craig Ganssle


Craig Ganssle is the Founder and CEO of Basecamp Networks. With over 20 years in
the technology industry, Craig has extensive experience developing and deploying
wireless networks and designing predictive learning solutions for complex problem
solving.
 
Craig started Basecamp Networks in 2007 providing global wireless network
infrastructures as well as creative solutions for difficult and time-consuming
IT issues. As a partner with Google since 2008, Craig was one of the original
Glass Explorers, Google’s original beta test group. In early 2013,
Craig advanced to an elite small team for this innovative technology. Since then,
under his leadership and Basecamp’s agricultural focus, Craig’s vision for Glass
led his team to develop intelliSCOUT®, the world's first wearable application
offering farmers a truly hands-free solution, enabling agricultural problem-solving
by collecting actionable insights from the field in a fraction of the time.
intelliSCOUT® technology has been demonstrated, in conjunction with the Basecamp
Networks’ offering, to dignitaries throughout the world, including France, where
Craig was personally requested to present this technology to President Francois Hollande.
In October 2016 Craig and Basecamp won the Atlanta Telecom Partnership (ATP)
Technology Service Provider of The Year Award (in addition to his achievements
in agricultural technological advancements).
 
Prior to founding Basecamp Networks, Craig was recruited by Verizon Wireless in
2001 where he oversaw U.S. Southeast Operations in the network engineering division
and was later tasked with deploying LTE in the Southeast United States. Craig’s
advanced innovative solutions are currently in use across Verizon’s entire company
footprint today.  During this time Craig also received a bachelor's degree from
Muhlenberg College in Business Administration, and a Computer Science degree from AIU.
 
In addition to his contributions in the public sector, Craig served honorably in the
United States Marine Corps as an intelligence communications operator with the Joint
Special Operations Command (JSOC) 2nd Force Recon Battalion. He was later assigned
as a detached "special operator" under the Department of the Navy, to Naval Special
Warfare Unit S.E.A.L. Teams as a "joint operator" before being honorably discharged
in 2001 for medical reasons. During his six years of service, Craig was highly
decorated with various commendations and medals for his service and valor.
 
Craig is very active in mission work with his church that includes providing internet
services in rural and remote locations globally. Basecamp Networks is headquartered
in Alpharetta, GA where Craig resides with his wife and children.
