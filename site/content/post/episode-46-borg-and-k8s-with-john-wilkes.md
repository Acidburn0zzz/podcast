Today we have the incredible honor to interview [John Wilkes](http://research.google.com/pubs/JohnWilkes.html),
Distinguished Engineer at Google and co-author of [the Borg paper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub43438.html),
about the history of Borg and how Kubernetes came to be.

And guess what, [Mark](https://twitter.com/neurotic) is very excited!
[Francesc](https://twitter.com/francesc) is excited too, though.

##### About John

John Wilkes has been at Google since 2008, where he is working on cluster management
and infrastructure services. Before that, he spent a long time at HP Labs, becoming
an HP and ACM Fellow in 2002.  He is interested in far too many aspects of
distributed systems, but a recurring theme has been technologies that allow systems
to manage themselves.

In his spare time he continues, stubbornly, trying to learn how to blow glass.
