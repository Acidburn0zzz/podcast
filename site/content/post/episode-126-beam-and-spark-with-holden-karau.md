##### Holden Karau

[Holden Karau](https://twitter.com/holdenkarau) is a transgender Canadian open source developer advocate @ Google with a focus on Apache Spark, BEAM, and related "big data" tools. She is the co-author of Learning Spark, High Performance Spark, and another Spark book that's a bit more out of date. She is a commiter on and PMC on Apache Spark and committer on SystemML & Mahout projects. She was tricked into the world of big data while trying to improve search and recommendation systems and has long since forgotten her original goal.

##### Question of the week

I have a continuous integration build process setup with Container Builder, but itâ€™s all sequential. I want to speed things up by processing parts of it in parallel. How do I do that?
