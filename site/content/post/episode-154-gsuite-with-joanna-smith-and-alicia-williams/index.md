G Suite is Google's collection of apps to help make working easier. It includes things like Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Calendar, and more and is designed to be collaborative. It's customizable, allowing users to adjust the programs to their needs and be more effective -- including integrating it with Google Cloud! G Suite has an active community of developers building add-ons to increase functionality as well.
