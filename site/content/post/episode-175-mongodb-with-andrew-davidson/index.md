On the podcast today we have a fascinating interview from our time at Cloud Next '19! [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) and [Jon](https://twitter.com/syntxerror1) went in-depth with Andrew Davidson about MongoDB to find out what they do and how they do it.

MongoDB is a document database that stores natively, making it super easy for developers. It's scalable, the information is highly available so it's easy to query, it has built-in replication, and can be run anywhere.

MongoDB Atlas is a global database service that works with Google Cloud and allows for better vertical and horizontal scaling with no down time. Atlas is a declarative model to manage your databases easily, makes it is super easy to migrate, and offers global clusters for faster runtimes.
 
In the future, Andrew sees a world where we think in terms of JSON-style documents instead of just tables. MongoDB can help make that happen.
