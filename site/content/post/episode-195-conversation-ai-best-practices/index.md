Conversational AI is our topic this week as your hosts [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) and [Priyanka Vergadia](https://twitter.com/pvergadia) are joined by [Cathy Pearl](https://twitter.com/cpearl42) and [Jessica Dene Earley-Cha](https://twitter.com/chatasweetie). Cathy explains what conversation AI is, describing it as people teaching computers to communicate the way humans do, rather than forcing humans to communicate like computers. 

Later, we talk best practices in design and development, including how a good conversation design and sample dialogues before building can create a better product. This prep work helps anticipate the ways different users could respond to the same question and how the program should react. In multi-modal programming, planning is also important. Our guests suggest starting with the spoken portions of the design and then planning visual components that would augment the experience. Working together as a team is one of the most important parts of the planning process.

We also talk best use-cases for conversation AI. Does performing this task via voice make the experience better? Does it make the task easier or more accessible? If so, that could be a great application. In the future, the conversation may be a silent communication with the help of MIT's Alter Ego.
