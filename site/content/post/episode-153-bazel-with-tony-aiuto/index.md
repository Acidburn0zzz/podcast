Happy Halloween! On this not-so-spooky episode of the Google Cloud Podcast, [Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) talk with Tony Aiuto of Bazel. Bazel grew from Google's internal build system, Blaze, to become the open source Bazel that it is today. The aim of the project is to quickly make very large builds across multiple languages.

##### Tony Aiuto
Tony is the tech-lead/manager for Bazel Product Excellence. He works on removing what enterprise users see as barriers to adoption. Tony's efforts are on bridging the gap between the piece of open source code that the developers see and the product that users want to see.
