We're back! This week, [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) welcomes [Gabi](https://twitter.com/gabidavila) as his new co-host! Listen in as they discuss Knative with [Mark Chmarny](https://twitter.com/mchmarny) and [Ville Aikas](https://twitter.com/AikasVille). 

So what is Knative? Mark and Ville explain that Knative is basically a way to simplify Kubernetes for developers. This way, developers can focus on writing good code without worrying about all the aspects of Kubernetes, such as deploying and autoscaling. Knative helps with these functions automatically. Knative also supports many languages which allows developers to bring their own stack. The day-to-day of developing doesn't change, which is the beautiful thing about Knative! 

Knative is open source and easy to deploy. Developers can find installation guides online for any Kubernetes certified instance of service. A link to the installation guide for Knative on GKE is in our show notes.
