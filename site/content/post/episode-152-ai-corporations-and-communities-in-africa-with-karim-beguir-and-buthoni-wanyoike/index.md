On the podcast today, we have two more fascinating interviews from [Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl)'s time at Deep Learning Indaba! [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) helps host this episode as we speak with [Karim Beguir](https://twitter.com/@kbeguir) and [Muthoni Wanyoike](https://twitter.com/_tabbz) about their company, Instadeep, the wonderful Indaba conference, and the growing AI community in Africa. 

Instadeep helps large enterprises understand how AI can benefit them. Karim stresses that it is possible to build advanced AI and machine learning programs in Africa because of the growing community of passionate developers and mentors for the new generation. Muthoni tells us about Nairobi Women in Machine Learning and Data Science, a community she is heavily involved with in Nairobi. The group runs workshops and classes for AI developers and encourages volunteers to participate by sharing their knowledge and skills.

##### Karim Beguir

[Karim Beguir](https://twitter.com/@kbeguir) helps companies get a grip on the latest AI advancements and how to implement them. A graduate of Franceâ€™s Ecole Polytechnique and former Program Fellow at NYU's Courant Institute, Karim has a passion for teaching and using applied mathematics. This led him to co-found InstaDeep, an AI startup that was nominated at the MWC17 for the Top 20 global startup list made by PCMAG. Karim uses TensorFlow to develop Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning products. Karim is also the founder of the TensorFlow Tunis Meetup. He regularly organises educational events and workshops to share his experience with the community. Karim is on a mission to democratize AI and make it accessible to a wide audience.

##### Muthoni Wanyoike

[Muthoni Wanyoike](https://twitter.com/_tabbz) is the team lead at Instadeep in Kenya. She is Passionate about bridging the skills gap in AI in Africa and does this by co-organizing the Nairobi Women in Machine Learning community. The community enables learning, mentorship, networking, and job opportunities for people interested in working in AI. She is experienced in research, data analytics, community and project management, and community growth hacking.
