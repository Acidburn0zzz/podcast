##### Mike Fotinakis

[Mike](https://twitter.com/mikefotinakis) is Co-Founder and CEO of Percy, where he is working on problems at the intersection of design, development, and deployment. Mike has previously worked as an engineer at companies including Google, Science Exchange, and AltSchool, and is now enjoying building his first company from the ground up. Sometimes, he even enjoys things that donâ€™t involve computers at all, including rock climbing, coffee, classical singing, and scuba diving.
