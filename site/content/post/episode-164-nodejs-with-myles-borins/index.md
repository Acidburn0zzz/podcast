Node.js is our topic this week as [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) and first-time host, [Jon Foust](https://twitter.com/syntxerror1), pick the brain of [Myles Borins](https://twitter.com/MylesBorins). Myles updates us on all the new things happening with Node.js, including the new .dev site that holds a ton of documentation to help people get started. Node.js now integrates with Cloud Build, the Node.js foundation has some new developments, and Google App Engine supports Node.js. The group has also been working on serverless containers.
