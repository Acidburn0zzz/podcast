On this episode, our hosts [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) and [Gabi Ferrara](https://twitter.com/gabidavila) dive into Google Cloud Platform UX with guest and Google Product Designer [Michael Kleinerman](https://twitter.com/m_kleinerman). Michael's path to Product Designer started with "ancient" tech designing with Flash and 3D motion graphics and progressed from there through interaction designer to his place now with Google. His experience has helped him appreciate the many different kinds of designers needed for projects and how they have to work together for a good product.

At Google, Michael's team builds design systems that create a balance between what Google uses and what the products built on Google use. He adopted Material Design, which offers guidelines for patterns and components of design, to Google Cloud. Material Design spans across multiple devices and screen sizes to help simplify design across devices. When Cloud reached the enterprise space, where components can be more complex, Michael's team worked to adjust Cloud using Material Design so that features like tables would work correctly.

Accessibility is also a top priority for Cloud and the design team. To begin the process of designing for accessibility, the team finds the top three or so reasons that a user would come to their product and ensures those are accessible to all. The next step is to create easier usability in the second tier features of the product, and then all features beyond. Using a screen reader, they go through the product to see if it's usable, and really try to make the experience better.  The team also makes sure there are a lot of guidance pages as well. 

The goal in product design is to make things simple and consistent for everyone.
