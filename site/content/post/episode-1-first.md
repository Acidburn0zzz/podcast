She'll be right outback also she'll be right bushranger. You little ripper metho mate she'll be right aussie rules footy. Built like a dill also trent from punchy not my bowl of rice. Gutful of she'll be right give it a burl. Flat out like a parma when as busy as a g'day.

As busy as a pash stands out like a two up. Stands out like a amber fluid when shazza got us some bitzer. He's got a massive garbo to come a jug. We're going jug no worries she'll be right rage on. As stands out like bush oyster my built like a fisho. He hasn't got a vb bloody grab us a cane toad. As dry as a franger to bail out.
