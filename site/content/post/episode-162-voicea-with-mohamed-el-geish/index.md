Today, [Mohamed El-Geish](https://twitter.com/elgeish) joins us to talk about the voice AI technology powering [Voicea](https://twitter.com/VoiceaCorp). [Gabi](https://twitter.com/gabidavila) is back on the host bench with [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) as we learn how Voicea can improve productivity. EVA, the voice assistant, will record important information for you so you can focus on your meeting and will create tasks lists to help you stay organized. Voicea integrates well with multiple platforms to help accomplish your goals as well. You can send messages to Slack, add tasks to your Basecamp list, and more.

Mohamed explains the process of building Voicea and how machine learning techniques and user feedback have helped make it such a useful tool. Now, Voicea is working to incorporate video, allowing users to play back things like important meeting slides.
