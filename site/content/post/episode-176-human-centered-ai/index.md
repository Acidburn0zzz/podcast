[Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) and [Michelle Casbon](https://twitter.com/texasmichelle) take over the show this week to discuss AI and the PAIR Guidebook to Human-Centered AI. [Mark Mandel](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) pops in on the interview, and [Di Dang](https://twitter.com/dqpdang), Design Advocate at Google, talks about her role in designing and building the guidebook with the intent of helping others create quality AI projects.

Di describes human-centered AI as a practice of not only being conscious of the project being built, but also considering how this AI project will impact us as humans at the end of the day. We influence machine learning so much, both intentionally and unintentionally, and it's our job to look at the project and results as a whole.

In the guidebook, topics like data bias in machine learning, what design patterns work, how to establish trust with the user, and more are addressed. Di explains that the guidebook is a work in progress that will develop with input from users and advances in technology.
