##### About Paul

[Paul](https://twitter.com/newsons_nybbles) is an SRE Advocate at Google.
As part of Googleâ€™s Cloud developer relations team, he helps our customers
understand reliability best practices based on my experiences working as a
Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) on Google Compute Engine and as a Software
Engineer on Google Cloud Storage.

Before joining Google, he cofounded a tiny game technology startup, sold it
to Microsoft, where he then worked on DirectX, Xbox, Xbox Live, and Forza
Motorsport, before spending some time working on interesting machine learning
problems in Microsoft Research.

Outside of work he enjoys rock climbing, motorcycling, and other activities
that demand complete focus.

He doesn't often post on social media, but when he does, he does it at
[@newsons_nybbles](https://twitter.com/newsons_nybbles).
