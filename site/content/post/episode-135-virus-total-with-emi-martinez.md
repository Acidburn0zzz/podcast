##### Emiliano (Emi) Martínez

Emiliano has been with VirusTotal for over 10 years. He has seen the business grow from a small startup in southern Spain into a Google X moonshot under the new Chronicle bet. He is a software engineer acting as the Tech Lead for VirusTotal. Throughout the past 10 years, not only has he been immersed in coding and architecting the platform, but he has also participated at all levels of the business: from bootstrapping the very first sales to working close with marketing and other teams in order to take the project to the next level. His main interests are IT security (more specifically malware) and designing products and services from scratch.
