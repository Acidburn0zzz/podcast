Our guest today is [Dr. Mario Lassnig](https://twitter.com/mlassnig), a software engineer working on the ATLAS Experiment at CERN! [Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) put on their physics hats as they learn all about what it takes to manage the petabytes of data involved in such a large research project.

##### Dr. Mario Lassnig

[Dr. Mario Lassnig](https://twitter.com/mlassnig) has been working as a Software Engineer at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) since 2006. Within the ATLAS Experiment, he is responsible for all aspects of its large-scale distributed data, including management, storage, network, and access. He is also one of the principal developers of the Rucio system for scientific data management. In his previous life, he developed mobile navigation software for multi-modal transportation in Vienna at Seibersdorf Research, as well as cryptographic smart-card applications for access control at the University of Klagenfurt. He holds a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Klagenfurt, and a doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Innsbruck.
