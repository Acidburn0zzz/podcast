Today on the podcast, we're speaking with [Chris Aniszczyk](https://twitter.com/cra) about the Linux Foundation and the important work they do to further the advancement of technology through open source initiatives. [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/markmirch) are your hosts this week, and they begin by speaking with Chris about what the Linux Foundation is and how it's unique.

The Linux Foundation, while seeking to support open source projects, sets itself apart by also providing professional services such as marketing, technical writing, legal help, and running events. It acts as a parent foundation for smaller open source foundations like Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Node.js Foundation, and the Automotive Linux Foundation, which strives to bring open source to the automotive industry.

Though typically companies can be leery of working with competitors, The Linux Foundation has been successful bringing companies together to create useful software that benefits everyone. Collaboration can be easier when done through the foundation. Chris also actively reaches out to companies in industries that don't typically engage in open source practices and encourages them to consider working together to make their industry better. Specifically, Chris works with companies within CNCF and the Open Container Initiative.
