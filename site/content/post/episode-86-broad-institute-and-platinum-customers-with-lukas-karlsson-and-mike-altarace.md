##### Question of the week

If I want to run a single node development Kubernetes cluster, and I donâ€™t want to pay for a Network LoadBalancer as well - how do I expose services?

- NodePort Services [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport)
- Configure a static IP for a Ingress Service [docs](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/tutorials/http-balancer#step_5_optional_configuring_a_static_ip_address)
