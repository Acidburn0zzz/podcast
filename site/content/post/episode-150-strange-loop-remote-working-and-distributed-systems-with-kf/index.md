[Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) celebrate their 150th episode this week with a high-energy interview of mutual friend, [KF](https://twitter.com/kf), at [Strange Loop](https://twitter.com/strangeloop_stl). KF gives her perspective on Strange Loop, working remotely, and distributed systems. She compliments Strange Loop for the diversity it has achieved as the conference has grown. She laments the lack of introductory material for distributed systems learners, saying it's not as complicated as everyone thinks but needs more educational material for beginners! In general, she believes everyone could benefit from some code study, especially if you can find a good mentor. KF also gives us some great tips for working remotely and staying effective and social.
