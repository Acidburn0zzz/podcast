Happy Independence Day to our American listeners! [Mark Mandel](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) is back today as he and [Gabi Ferrara](https://twitter.com/gabidavila) interview Bill Creekbaum of Informatica to learn how they work with Google Cloud for a better big data user experience. [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) is hanging around the studio as well, bringing some cool things of the week and helping with the question of the week!

Informatica provides data managing products that offer complete solutions focusing on metadata management, integration, governance, security, data quality, and discoverability. Bill's job at Informatica is to ensure these products really take advantage of the strengths of Google Cloud Platform. One such example is a product that allows customers to design in Informatica and push their projects to Cloud Dataproc. Informatica also offers similar capabilities in BigQuery. When moving data from on-prem to the cloud, customers can use Informatica and Google Cloud together for a seamless transition, cost savings, and easier data control.

Together, Informatica and Google Cloud can also facilitate the acquisition of high quality data. To have better, more trustworthy output, data inputed needs to be safe to access, have few or no duplicates and null values, and be complete. To achieve this, developers usually use a combination of the Informatica tools Intelligent Cloud Services, Enterprise Data Catalog, and Big Data Management, and the Google tools BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Analytics, Dataproc, and Pub/Sub.

Bill's closing advice for companies comes in three parts: take stock of the data you've got, set goals, and develop a well-rounded team.
