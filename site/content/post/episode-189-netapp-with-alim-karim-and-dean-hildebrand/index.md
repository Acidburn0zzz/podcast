[Jon Foust](https://twitter.com/syntxerror1) joins [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) this week as we meet up with [Alim Karim](https://twitter.com/alim__k) from NetApp and Technical Director in OCTO [Dean Hildebrand](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dean) of Google. NetApp has been in data management for 20 years, focusing on providing on-prem, high-performance storage solutions for large industry clients. Their recent partnership with Google Cloud has allowed them to expand their services, offering the same great data management and storage in the cloud. 

Dean and Alim elaborate on the best uses for NetApp, explaining that lifting and shifting an existing project to the cloud is only one way NetApp can be useful. New projects can be built right in Google Cloud with NetApp as well. Our guests discuss the other pros of the NetApp service, including faster data retrieval, better monitoring, and predictability. We also talk about how NetApp takes customer feedback into consideration to make sure their service is the best it can be for every client. What's in store for the future of NetApp? Listen in to find out!
