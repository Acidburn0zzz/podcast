Google's own [Billy Jacobson](https://twitter.com/billyjacobson) joins hosts [Mark Mandel](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) and [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) this week to dive deeper into Cloud Bigtable. Bigtable is Google's petabyte scale, fully managed, NoSQL database. Billy elaborates on what projects Bigtable works best with, like time-series data user analytics, and why it's such a great tool. It offers huge scalability with the benefits of a managed system, and it's flexible and easily customized so users can turn on and off the pieces they need. 

Later, we learn about other programs that are compatible with Bigtable, such as JanusGraph, Open TSDB, and GeoMesa. Bigtable also supports the API for HBase, an open-source project similar to Bigtable. Because of this, it's easy for HBase users to move to Bigtable, and the Bigtable community has access to many open source libraries. Billy also talks more about the nine clients available, and when customers might want to use Bigtable instead of, or in conjunction with, other Google services such as Spanner and BigQuery.
