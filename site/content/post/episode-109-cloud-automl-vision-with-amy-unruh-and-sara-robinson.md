[Amy Unruh](https://twitter.com/amygdala) and [Sara Robinson](http://twitter.com/SRobTweets) join the podcast this week to talk with [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) and [Melanie](https://twitter.com/nyghtowl) about the alpha launch of Cloud AutoML Vision. 

Cloud AutoML is a suite of products enabling developers with limited ML expertise to build high quality models using transfer learning and Neural Architecture Search techniques. AutoML Vision is the first product out the gate with a focus on making it easy to train customized vision models.
