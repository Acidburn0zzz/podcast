We're at Cloud Next this week with special guests, special hosts, and more! On day one, [Gabi](https://twitter.com/gabidavila) and new host [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) were able to speak with Jonathan Cham, Customer Engineer at Google Cloud, about his experiences with Google Next. Ori of the Cloud SQL team shared exciting news about Cloud SQL Server.

Later, [Aja](https://twitter.com/the_thagomizer) was joined by co-host [Brian Dorsey](https://twitter.com/briandorsey) who elaborated on his Next talk, as well as his favorite things at Next.
