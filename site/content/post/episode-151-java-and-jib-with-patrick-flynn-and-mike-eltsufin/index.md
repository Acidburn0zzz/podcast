##### Question of the week

What if we have an object in Google Cloud Storage, and I want to automatically change an aspect of it -- such as:

 * Downgrade the storage class of objects older than 365 days to Coldline Storage.
 * Delete objects created before January 1, 2013.
 * Keep only the 3 most recent versions of each object in a bucket with versioning enabled.
