##### Question of the week

Francesc answers our question of the week, "Should you do ML in Go?". 
Short answer? Probably not. [Python](https://www.python.org) may be the better choice.
If you do want to experiment with Go and ML, try [Gonum](https://www.gonum.org), [Gorgonia](https://github.com/gorgonia), or [TensorFlow for Go](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_go).
