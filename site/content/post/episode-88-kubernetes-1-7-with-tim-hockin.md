##### About Tim Hockin

Tim was one of the first engineers on Kubernetes and GKE, where he has been involved in things
like networking, storage, node management, API, plugins, and more.  Before Kubernetes, he worked
on Google’s internal systems, Borg and Omega, mostly on the node management side, and on Google’s
machine management, hardware bringup, and kernels.

He has been contributing to open-source projects since 1995, when he first learned C.
