[Jon Foust](https://twitter.com/syntxerror1) is back with [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) this week as we talk about SAP HANA, a data and application platform. [Lucia Subatin](https://twitter.com/LuciaBlick) and [Kevin Nelson](https://twitter.com/knelsoncloud) elaborate, explaining that SAP HANA is engineered for running SAP business applications. It is capable of handling large transactions very quickly and with great flexibility. With HANA, you don't move data around, so you can run transaction workloads, as well as analytics, etc. in the same platform.

By teaming up with GCP, SAP HANA ensures that their enterprise users will have scalability and storage no matter how their businesses grow. GCP and SAP HANA developers have been working together to continue to make the products better.
