### Questions of the Week

Every week we take questions submitted to us by our audience, and answer them live on
the podcast. If you have a question you would like to hear answered, please [send us an email](mailto:hello@gcppodcast.com?subject=Question of the Week)
with the question, and we'll endeavour to answer it on the show.

### Cool Things of the Week

Every week, we go through a "Cool Thing" - it could be a great project running on Google Cloud Platform, a
fantastic tip or trick on Google Cloud Platform, an Open Source project or really just about anything we
think is new and innovative. If you have something that you think would fit this, [send it through](mailto:hello@gcppodcast.com?subject=Cool Thing of the Week) and
we will consider it to be featured on our show!
